# Boilerplate for SQL Environment

in developement


## Environment 

This boilerplate will be written using Javascript in the NodeJS environment, using the POSTGRESQL and Express.

Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install NodeJS.

The package manager npm will be installed with it.

I recommend the use of [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install NodeJS.

### Unit testing and functional testing

The unit tests will be written and conducted with Jest.

They will test the classes we use to create account objects and modify the account's balance and history.

The functional tests will be written with Cucumber-JS.

They will simulate all of the application process (Account creation => log in => logout => account deletion and deposit / withdrawal) in real-time via endpoint testing.


## Installation

This section will be available when the boilerplate is complete
